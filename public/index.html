    <h1>How to properly log an issue</h1>
    <p>Logging issues (or defects) on your project are inevitable. Here is a quick guide to help you log your issue in a manner that helps the recipient of the issue to work most efficiently and reduces any back and forth that might waste your time.</p>
    <section class="step">
      <div class="number-container"><span class="number">1</span></div>
      <div class="content">
        <h2>Assume the recipient knows nothing</h2>
        <p>Sure, it seems entirely reasonable that when you say "[X] is broken" that the recipient of your issue will know exactly what your talking about. <strong>That's not the case though.</strong></p>
        <p>When filing your issue, assume that the recipient knows nothing about what you're talking about. There is no such thing as too many details when filing your issue.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <div class="number-container"><span class="number">2</span></div>
      <div class="content">
        <h2>The title should be descriptive</h2>
        <p>"[X] doesn't look right" is a bad title when creating your issue. <strong>The title should be as descriptive as possible.</strong> It should be so descriptive that the recipient should be able to pick up the gist of the issue from the title itself.</p>
        <h3>Some Examples</h3>
        <blockquote>The blue widget on the contact page has white space issues</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Clicking on "Create" throws a 500 error</blockquote>
        <blockquote>The blue muppet should be green</blockquote>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="step">
      <div class="number-container"><span class="number">3</span></div>
      <div class="content">
        <h2>The description should be overly descriptive</h2>
        <p>Even the simplest of issues should have an overly descriptive description. Again, there is no such thing as too much information. A well logged issue will include the location of the issue, steps to reproduce the issue (only needed if more complex), and what the desired outcome of the issue is.</p>
        <h3>Some Examples</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>On the contact page, I was expecting the blue widget to have less white space.</p>
          <p>Can we tighten up the spacing between the blocks in the blue widget?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>I tried to create a new recipe, but I am getting the attached error.</p>
          <p><strong>Steps to reproduce:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sign in to the site</li>
            <li>Click the "Create" button on your dashboard</li>
            <li>See attached 500 error</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please fix the 500 error.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The blue muppet on the muppet details page is green.</p>
          <p><strong>Steps to reproduce:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Go to muppet details page</li>
            <li>See blue muppet in the leaderboard</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Can you make the blue muppet green per the mockup from August 10, 2012?</p>

        <h2>Big Errors</h2>
        <p>If the issue that you are logging is the result of a big error. The error should be attached to your issue via a text file. Copy the error and paste it into your favorite text editor (Notepad, not MS Word). Once you have a file, attach it to your issue as a file.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>Screenshots</h2>
        <p>You should try to include screenshots for all logged issues, but it is required to file an issue with a screenshot if the issue is related to the styling of the page.</p>
        <p>When taking a screenshot, <strong>do not paste the screenshot into MS Word or Powerpoint</strong>. This causes the screenshot to be illegible to the recipient and they will simply ask you for another.</p>
        <p>On a Mac you can take a screenshot with CMD+SHIFT+4. This will put a screenshot on your desktop which can easily be uploaded directly.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>Issues are atomic</h2>
        <p>Once the recipient of the issue has fixed the issue and you have verified that the reported issue is fixed, the issue is closed. If you have related issues, or a new issue was created in the fix, <strong>you must open a new issue</strong>. This will increase the ticket count, but it helps work to happen most efficiently.</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <p>If you follow these steps for the issues that you create, you can help everyone work more efficiently and save yourself the headache of passing issues back and forth.</p>
